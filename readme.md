#Welcome to my professional portfolio!

###Built With:
- <b>React (ES6)</b> because I've been tinkering with it for a couple months and I figured this would be a straightforward project with little state change to manage.
- <b>Webpack</b> because it's the hot new task manager in town.
- <b>SASS</b> because it's the best.
